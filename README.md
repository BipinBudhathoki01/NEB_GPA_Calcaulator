## 🧠 Why I Made This Project

Many NEB students, especially those in Class 11 and 12, struggle to calculate their GPA properly. Most existing tools are either outdated or do not follow NEB's unique grading and credit system.

So, I built this GPA calculator to:
- Help NEB students calculate their GPA easily and correctly.
- Provide a clean, mobile-friendly UI that works on both desktop and smartphones.
- Share it as an open-source project so anyone can use or improve it.
